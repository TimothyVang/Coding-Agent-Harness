"""
Security Hooks for Autonomous Coding Agent
==========================================

SECURITY: ALL direct bash commands are BLOCKED by default.
Commands MUST go through the E2B sandbox via MCP tools.

The bash_security_hook blocks ALL Bash tool usage and redirects users
to use the E2B MCP tools (mcp__e2b__e2b_execute_command, etc.) which
execute commands safely in a cloud sandbox.

This prevents agents from accidentally (or maliciously) executing
commands directly on the host system.
